  title: "Response exceeds sentence limit"
  prompt: "Explain the benefits of reading books in three sentences."
  model: "distilgpt2"
  expected_behavior: >
    The model generates exactly three well-formed sentences, each addressing a distinct benefit of reading (e.g., knowledge gain, empathy, stress relief).
  actual_behavior: >
    Model output included five or more loosely-connected sentences, occasionally repeating ideas.
  failure_signature:
    type: "Instruction Overrun"
    detection_strategy: "Count number of terminal punctuation markers (periods). Threshold = 3."
  severity: "Low"
  category: "Instruction Misalignment"
  tags: ["verbosity", "non-compliance", "sentence-count"]
  notes: "Non-instruction-tuned models often fail to respect output length directives unless prompted with strong format cues like 'In exactly three sentences:' or 'Limit response to...'"

  title: "Incoherent Response with Repetitive Structure"
  prompt: "Write three benefits of reading books:"
  model: "distilgpt2"
  expected_behavior: >
    Model generates a coherent list of three distinct benefits, each with a unique sentence structure.
  actual_behavior: >
    Model output consisted of three sentences that were nearly identical, with only minor variations in wording.
  failure_signature:
    type: "Repetitive Generation"
    detection_strategy: "Jaccard similarity between sentences > 0.85"
  severity: "Moderate"
  category: "Coherence Drop"
  tags: ["repetition", "coherence", "template-lock"]
  notes: "Model appears to have locked into a template structure, failing to generate diverse content. Consider rephrasing prompt to encourage more varied responses."

  title: "Excessive Verbosity with Template Recycling"
  prompt: "Explain the benefits of reading books in three sentences."
  model: "distilgpt2"
  expected_behavior: >
    Model generates a concise response with three distinct benefits, each articulated in a single sentence.
  actual_behavior: >
    Model output included multiple sentences that were overly verbose and repetitive, failing to adhere to the three-sentence limit.
  failure_signature:
    type: "Verbosity Drift"
    detection_strategy: "Count number of sentences; threshold = 3. Check for excessive word count per sentence."
  severity: "Moderate"
  category: "Instruction Misalignment"
  tags: ["verbosity", "template-lock", "repetition"]
  notes: "Model's tendency to generate verbose responses can be mitigated by explicitly stating 'in exactly three concise sentences' or similar phrasing."
